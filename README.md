This analysis aims to:
- Provide actionable insights for hotel managers and analysts to reduce cancellations
- Demonstrate proficiency in Excel-based data analysis and visualization
- Strengthen portfolio credibility for technical roles in data science and analytics
- Serve as a foundation for future integration with tools like Python, Power BI, and MySQL
