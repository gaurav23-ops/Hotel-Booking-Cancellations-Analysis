# Hotel-Booking-Cancellations(Interactive Dashboard Using MS Excel)
## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to uncover patterns and trends in cancellation behavior. Using Microsoft Excel, the project leverages pivot tables and dashboards to explore how factors such as hotel type, guest demographics, room preferences, and seasonal timing influence cancellation rates.
This analysis aims to:
- Provide actionable insights for hotel managers and analysts to reduce cancellations
- Demonstrate proficiency in Excel-based data analysis and visualization
- Strengthen portfolio credibility for technical roles in data science and analytics
- Serve as a foundation for future integration with tools like Python, Power BI, and MySQL
